From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1.
Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.

The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:

In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.

Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
'''

pt1_x = 3
pt1_y= 1

pt2 = [ [1,1], [3,1], [5,1], [7,1], [1,2] ]

dots_and_hash = []
with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        stripped = line.rstrip('\n')
        dots_and_hash.append(stripped)


def slope(dots_and_hash, mv_x, mv_y):
    trees = 0
    x = 0
    y = 0
    while y < len(dots_and_hash)-1:
        for i in range(0, mv_x):
            x = (x + 1) % (len(dots_and_hash[y]))

        for i in range(0, mv_y):
            y += 1

        if dots_and_hash[y][x] == '#':
            trees += 1

    return trees

print(slope(dots_and_hash, pt1_x, pt1_y))

Time to check the rest of the slopes - you need to minimize the probability of a sudden arboreal stop, after all.

Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:

Right 1, down 1.
Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
Right 5, down 1.
Right 7, down 1.
Right 1, down 2.
In the above example, these slopes would find 2, 7, 3, 4, and 2 tree(s) respectively; multiplied together, these produce the answer 336.

What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes?
'''
more_trees = 1
for i in pt2:
    more_trees = more_trees * slope(dots_and_hash, i[0], i[1])

print(more_trees)
